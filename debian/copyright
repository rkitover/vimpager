License: Vim
 I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
     that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
     unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
     include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
     that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
     examples and Vim scripts.
 .
 II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
     including executables and/or source code, when the following four
     conditions are met:
     1) This license text must be included unmodified.
     2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
        a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
 	  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
 	  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
 	  must make your changes, including source code, available to the
 	  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
 	  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
 	  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
 	  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
 	  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
 	  The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>.  If this
 	  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
 	  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely
 	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
 	  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
 	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
        b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
 	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
 	  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the
 	  text under a) applies to those changes.
        c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
 	  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
 	  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you
 	  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
 	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
        d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
 	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
 	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
 	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
 	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
 	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
 	    version of Vim without fee or restriction.
 	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
 	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
 	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
 	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
 	    available to him.
 	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
 	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
 	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
 	    as possible.
        e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
 	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
 	  any later version.
     3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
        command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
        is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
        under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
        not conflict with the license used for the changes.
     4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
        removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
        corrections.
 .
 III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
      the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
      maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
      by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
      If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
      context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
      <maintainer@vim.org>
 .
 IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
      sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
      license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
      with, at your option.
