description:
A slightly more sophisticated replacement for less.sh that also supports being
set as the PAGER environment variable. Displays man pages, perldocs and python
documentation properly. Works on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OSX,
Cygwin and msys. Should work on most other systems as well.

On github:
http://github.com/rkitover/vimpager
 
install details:
mkdir ~/bin
cp vimpager ~/bin
chmod +x ~/bin/vimpager
alternative install:
PREFIX=~ make install

# put these in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PAGER=~/bin/vimpager
alias less=$PAGER
alias zless=$PAGER

Put the following into your ~/.vimrc if you want to use gvim/MacVim for your pager window:

let vimpager_use_gvim = 1

Cygwin notes:

The Cygwin gvim is very buggy, vimpager works correctly with the native
Windows gvim, just put it in your PATH.
