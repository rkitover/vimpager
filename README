NAME
====

vimpager - less.sh replacement

SYNOPSIS
========

cat some_file | vimpager

DESCRIPTION
===========

A slightly more sophisticated replacement for less.sh that also supports
being set as the PAGER environment variable. Displays man pages,
perldocs and python documentation properly. Works on Linux, Solaris,
FreeBSD, OSX, Cygwin and msys. Should work on most other systems as
well.

On GitHub: http://github.com/rkitover/vimpager

To use it as as your PAGER: put these in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc

    export PAGER=~/bin/vimpager
    alias less=$PAGER
    alias zless=$PAGER

Put the following into your ~/.vimrc if you want to use gvim/MacVim for
your pager window:

    let vimpager_use_gvim = 1

CYGWIN NOTES
============

The Cygwin gvim is very buggy, vimpager works correctly with the native
Windows gvim, just put it in your PATH.
