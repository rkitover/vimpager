vimpager - less.sh replacement
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
cat \f[I]some_file\f[] | vimpager
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A slightly more sophisticated replacement for less.sh that also supports
being set as the PAGER environment variable.
Displays man pages, perldocs and python documentation properly.
Works on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OSX, Cygwin and msys.
Should work on most other systems as well.
.PP

.PP
To use it as as your PAGER: put these in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export\ PAGER=~/bin/vimpager
alias\ less=$PAGER
alias\ zless=$PAGER
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To use a different vimrc with vimpager, put your settings into a
~/.vimpagerrc or a file pointed to by the VIMPAGER_RC environment
variable.
.PP
You can also have a global config file for all users in /etc/vimpagerrc,
users can override it by creating a ~/.vimpagerrc.
.PP
To disable loading plugins, put "set noloadplugins" into a ~/.vimpagerrc
file.
.PP
You can also switch on the "vimpager" variable in your vimrc to set
alternate settings for vimpager.
.PP
Put the following into your .vimrc/.vimpagerrc if you want to use
gvim/MacVim for your pager window:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_use_gvim\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To pass through text that is smaller than the terminal height (without
highlighting, at present) use this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_passthrough\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To start vim with -X (no x11 connection, a bit faster startup) put the
following into your .vimrc/.vimpagerrc:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_disable_x11\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The scroll offset (:help scrolloff), may be specified by placing the
following into your .vimrc/.vimpagerrc (default = 5, disable = 0):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_scrolloff\ =\ 5
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The process tree of vimpager is available in the "vimpager_ptree"
variable, an example usage is as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
if\ exists("vimpager")
\ \ if\ exists("vimpager_ptree")\ &&\ vimpager_ptree[-2]\ ==\ \[aq]wman\[aq]
\ \ \ \ set\ ft=man
\ \ endif
endif
\f[]
.fi
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.SS + | +G
.PP
Start at the end of the file, just like less.
.SH CYGWIN NOTES
.PP
The Cygwin gvim is very buggy, vimpager works correctly with the native
Windows gvim, just put it in your PATH.
