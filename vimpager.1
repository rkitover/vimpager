To use it as as your PAGER: put these in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc

      export\ PAGER=~/bin/vimpager

      alias\ zless=$PAGER

Put the following into your ~/.vimrc if you want to use gvim/MacVim
for your pager window:
.PP

.SH CYGWIN NOTES
.PP
The Cygwin gvim is very buggy, vimpager works correctly with the
native Windows gvim, just put it in your PATH.
